is new: it was thought expedient, not so much lohere respect boun
plesse and satisly either oi these parties, as how to plesse God, and prodt
them both. And yet lest any man should be offendcd, whom good reason
might satislp, here be certain causes rendered, why some ol the accartomel
Geremouies be put away, and some retained and lrept still.

Some are put away, because the great excess and multitude ot tben

- bath so increased in these latter days, that the burden ol them ruas in·

tolerable; whereol Saint Augustino in his time complained, tbat tbep
were grown ιο such a number, that the estate ol Christian people wasia
worse case conceming that matter, than were the Jews. And bs cous
selled that such yolre aud burden should be taken away, as time would
serve quietly ιο do it. Bnt what would Saint Augustino bave sud, il
he had seen the ceremonies ol late days used among us; wbereumo the
multitude used in his time was not to be compared? 'lhis our excessire
multitudo ol Ceremonies was so great, and many oi them so darh, thet
they did more conluund and darken, than declare and set tortu Christ's
benehts unto us. hnd besides this, christe Gospel is not a Geremonial
Law, (as much ol lloses' Law was) but it is a Religion to serve llud,
not in bondage ol the ligure or shadow, but in the freedom ol the spirit:

cause ol the abolishment ol certain Ceremonies was, That they were so
far abused, partly by the superstitious blindness ol the rude aud unleamed,
and partly by the unsatiable avarice ol such as songht more their own
lucre, than the glory ol God, that the abusos could not well be talea
away, the thing remaining still.

batnon as eonceming those persons, which peradventure will be
· odended, lor that some ol the old Geremonies are retained still: litbep
consider that without some Ceremonies it is not possible to keep arr
0rder, or quiet Disciplina in the Charch, they shall easily perceire jot
cause to reform their judgements. And tt they think much, that any ol us
old do remain, and would rather have all devised auew; then sach mer
grautiug some ceremonias convenient tc be had, surely where the old mar
be well used, there they cannot reasonablp reprove the old only lortbeir
age, without bewraping ol their own tolly. For in such acase theyorght
rather to have reverence unto them lor their antiquity, ilthey will declaro
themselves ιο be more studious ol unity and concord, than ol innovatus

and new-langleness, which (as much as may be with true setting toul
ol Chriet's Religion) is always ιο be eschewed. Furthermore, such shall
