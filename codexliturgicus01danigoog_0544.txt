0 come, let us give thanhs anto the bord, for heis
ciens: and his marey endureth for ever.

Great is the bord, and greatly to be praised3 let
redeemed of the bord say so: whom hc hath delivered l

He hatb not dealt with us according to cur sins: nel
rewarded us according to our iniquities.

But as the heaven is high above the earth: so great
been his mercy towards us. ’

We found trouble and heavfness: we were even atde
door.

The waters of the sea had well-nigh covered usz the pr
waters had well-high gone over our soul.

h The sca rcared: and the stormy wind liftcd up the w
tereo.

We were carried up as it were to heaven, and thend
again into thee deep: our soal melted within us, becaos
trouble3

Then cried we unto thee, Obord: and thou didst de
, us out of oar distress.

Blessed be chy Name‚ who didst not despise the pr
of thy servants: but didst hear our cry, and host saved a*

storm caused, and was turned into a calm.

Olet us therefore praise the bord for his goodness:

declara the wonders that ho hath done7 and still doeth fo
children of men. .
