'lo the end that Couiirmutioo may be ministered ιο the more ediiyiog οι
clv as stunt receive it (according noto St. Paol's doctrine, who teachcth, that all
iugc should bc dune in the church to the edificatiou citha same) it is thought
scd that none hereaiter shall he confirmed, bot such as cau say io their mother
agne the articles οι the luith, the Lord's Prayer, aud the teu Commaudmeota:
vd cau atso aoswer to such questions οι this short Catcchism os tha Bishop (cr
sch as he shall appoint) shall hy his discretico appose thern vu: aod this order
mosi convenient to bs observed lor divers consideratione.

tirsi, because that when children come ιο the years oi discretim, and bave
arceo what their godlethers aud godmothere promised lor them indeptum,
iey may theu themselves with their ovvo mouth, aud with their civo consent,
pculy belona the choreb, ratity aud coohrm the same: aod aleo promise ιιιιιι,Ι
ythe grace oi eod, they will evermero endeavour themselves iaithlully ιο ob·

neutcd unte.

madly, lorasnuch as (icoltrmatioo is ministered ιο them that be baptiaed,
avt by 'impositico ci hands eud prayer they may receive strength, aud deleuce
gainst ali temptatione ιο siu, and the assaolts ol the world, aod the Devil: it
ι uacet meet ιο be ministered when children come tc that age, that partly hy
vc lrailty cl their contestu, partly by the aasaoits cl the world aod the licvit,
say begin to bc in danger to leli into sondry kinds οι ein.

Thirdly‚ lor that it is agreeable with the usage oi the Church io times past,
¹bereby it vvas ordained that confirmation should be ministered to them that
ere oi perlect age, that they, being instructed iu Christ's religion, should
pcniy prolcss their ooo saith, and promise ιο he obedient uoto the wilt ol (iod.

And that uc man shall think that any detriment shall come ιο children by
elerriug oi their Confirmatioo he shall lvoovv lor truth thal it ss certain by
od's word, that children being baptism, have all things necessary ior theu
lvation, aad bc undoubtedly saved.
