There wasa man oi the phariseos, named Nicodemns hc.
- so is every one that is horn ol the Spirit ·
Alter which he shall sap this Exhortation following.

Beloved‚ ye hear in this Gospel the express words ol oar
Savionr carisa· that except a man he horn ol water and of
the Sptrtt, he cannot enter into the kingdom ol' God. Wherehy ·
pe may perceivc the great necessity ol this Sacrament, where
it may he had. hiltewise„ immediately helore his ascension into
heaven, (as we read in the last Chapter ol Saint hlarh’s Gospel„)
he gave command to hie disciples„ saping‚ Go pe into all the
world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. lle that he-
lieveth and is haptiaed shall he saved3 hut he that believeth
not shall he damned. Which also sheweth unto us the great
henefit we reap therehp. For which cause Saint Petcr the
Apostle, when upon his first preaching ol the Gospel many
were priched at the heart, and said to him and the rest of the

Apostles, lllen and hrethrem what shall we do? replied and,
said anto them, Repent‚ and he haptiaed every one ol you
ior the remission oi sins‚ and pe shall receive the gill ol the

llolp Ghost. For the promise is lo you and your children, ,

md to all that are afar oh, even as many as the Lord our
(lod shall call. And with many other words exhorted he them,
apag, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. For
(rs the same Apostle testilieth in another place) even Baptism

tp the resurrectiones lesus Christ. Douht ye not therefore,
ln earnestly believe, that he will lavourahly receive these
present persona, truly repeating and coming anto him hy raith-3
tta he will grant mem remissiones their sins, and hestow
tpon nem the holy Ghost3 that he will give them the hlessing
