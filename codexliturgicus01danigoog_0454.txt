.· ,Deurly beloved bretbreu‚ ou - liutend„ by God’s graeca
, celebrate the hord's Supperz unto which, in God's bahali,
’ ‘d you all that arehere present 3 and beseech you, for the
· ,“ rd Jesus Christ's sabe, that ye will not refuso⁸ ιο come the-
to, being so loviugly called aud bidden by God himself. Ye
w how grievous and unkind a thing it is, when a man bath
pared u rich feast3 decked his table with all kind of provi-
ὀο, so that there lacheth nothing bnt the guests ιο sit down3
yet they who are called (without any cause) most unthanlr-
“ y refuso to come. Which of you iu such a case would not
’ noved? Who would not thinh a great injury aud wrong
flore unio nunt Wherefors, most dearly beloved in Christ, taho
xe good head, lest ys, withdrawiug yourselves from this holy
Smper, provoke God's indignation against you. lt is an easy
'⁸ Ιιιιιοτ for a man to say, l will not communicate, because l am
,· otherwise hindered with worldly business. But such excuses
'- -are not so easily accepted and allowed before God. lf any mau
-k-uy, 1 am a grievous sinner, aud therefore am afraid lo comet
wherefore then do ye not repent aud amend? When God culleth
you, are ys nol ashamed ιο say ye will not come? When ye
- should return ιο (iod, will ye excuse yourselvss‚ and say ye
a're not ready? Consider earnestly with yourselves how little
such feigned excuses will ovail before God. They that refused
the least iu the Gospel, because they had bought a farm, or
would try their yohes oi oxon, or because they were married
· wore not so excused‚ but conuted unworthy of the heavenly
feast l, for my part, shall be ready3 and, according to mine

’ llice, lbid you in the Name of God, lcall you in Chrisl's
lebab, l exhort you, as ye love your own salvation‚ that ye '
will be perlabens of this holy communion. And as the Son of
dod did vonchsale to yield up his soul by death upon the
bross for your salvation3 so it is your duty ιο receive the
communion in remembrauce of the sacrifice of his death, us he
himself hath commanded: which if ye shall neglect to do, cou-
sider with yourselves how great injury yc do unto eod, aud '
