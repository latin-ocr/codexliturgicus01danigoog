Dearly beloved in the hond, ye that mind to come ιο ιι(
hely Communium ol the Body and Blood of our Saviour Christ(
must consider how Saint Paul exhorteth all persons diligently
ιο try and examine themselves, helore they presume ιο eatul
that oreae, and driak ol that Cap. For as the heneht isrgreat,
il with a true penitent heart and lively leith we receive that
holy Sacrament3· (lor then we spirituallp eat the llesh ol Christ
and drink his blood3 then we dwell in Christ, and Christ ir
ns3 we are one with Christ, anvl Christ with us3) so istie
danger great, if we receive the same unworthily. For ther
wo are guilty ol the Bady and Blood of Christ our Savium
we eat and drink our own damnatiom not considering the Lorl’s
Bodp; we kindle God's wrath against ns3 we provehe him ιο
