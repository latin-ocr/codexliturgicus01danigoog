you the wretchedness of your condition, and declare how im
you ought to depend on the mercies of God, and the merit
of our Saviour. Consider then seriously with yourself‚ intll
appearance the time of your dissolution draweth near3 you
sins have laid fast hold upon you3 you are soon ιο be removed
from among men hy a violent death3 and you shall fade awry
suddenly like the grass, which in the morning is green arf
groweth up, hut in the evening is cut down7 dried up, anf
withered. After you have thus finished the course of a sin·
ful and miserahle tite, you shall appear hefore the Judgeof
all teste who, as he pronounces hlessings on the righteeus,
shall lilrewise saya witha terrihle voice of most just jungent
to the wished, (io, ye accursum, into the fine everlasting‚ pre ,
pared for the devil and his angels.

Your sins have brought you too near this dreadful sen
tence: it is therefore your part and duty, my brother, humhly
to confess ond hewail your great and manifold offences, and
ιο repent you truly of your sins, as you tender the 'eternal
salvation of your soul. ¹

Be not deceived with a vain and presumptuous expectatio!
of God's favour, nor say within yourself‚ Peuce, Posce, where
there is no peace3 forthere is no peace, saith my God, totle
wicfred. God is not mocked3 he is of purer eyes than to he
hold iniquity3 and without holiness no man shall see the Lord.
011 the other hand, despair not of God's mercy‚ though trouhla ς

‘ s is on every side3 for God shutteth not up his mercies for ever

in displeasure: But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unright- ⁴
Α eousness. Do not either way ahuse the goodness of (ἔοι, who
calleth us mercifully to omendment‚ and of his endless pity
promiseth us forgiveness 0f that which is past, if with a per·
fect and true heert we return unto him.

Since therefore you are soon ιο pass into on endless and
unohangeahle state, and your future happiness or misery de
pends upon the few momente which are left y0u; l require
you strictly ιο examine yourself‚ and your estate hoth towards
God and towards man3 und let no worldly consideration hindei
you from making a true and full, confession of your sins, and
giving all the satisfaction which is in your power ιο every one
whom you have wronged or injured3 that you may lind mercy ,
